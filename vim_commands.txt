--General Purpose Mappings--

Insert line in Normal-mode
nnoremap <M-u> o<ESC>
nnoremap <M-i> O<ESC>

Move line up/down and reindent
nnoremap <M-j> :m .+1<CR>==
nnoremap <M-k> :m .-2<CR>==
inoremap <M-j> <Esc>:m .+1<CR>==gi
inoremap <M-k> <Esc>:m .-2<CR>==gi

Move Visual block, reindent and reselect
vnoremap <M-j> :m '>+1<CR>gv=gv
vnoremap <M-k> :m '<-2<CR>gv=gv

Use system clipboard
nnoremap <Leader>p "*p
nnoremap <Leader>y "*y
nnoremap <Leader>d "*d
